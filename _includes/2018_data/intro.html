			<p>Mutation is acknowledged as an important way to assess the fault-finding effectiveness of tests. Mutation testing has mostly been applied at the source code level, but more recently, related ideas have also been used to test artifacts described in a considerable variety of notations and at different levels of abstraction. Mutation ideas are used with requirements, formal specifications, architectural design notations, informal descriptions (e.g., use cases) and hardware. Mutation is now established as a major concept in software and systems V&V and uses of mutation are increasing.</p>

			<p>Mutation 2018 is the 13th in the series of international workshops focusing on mutation analysis. The workshop will be held in conjunction with the International Conference on Software Testing, Verification, and Validation (ICST 2018). Accepted papers will be published as part of the ICST proceedings.</p>

			<p>The goal of the Mutation workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss new and emerging trends in mutation analysis.</p><br>

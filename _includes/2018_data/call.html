<p><span>Mutation is acknowledged as an
important way to assess the fault-finding effectiveness of test sets. Mutation
testing has mostly been applied at the source code level, but more recently,
related ideas have also been used to test artefacts described in a considerable
variety of notations and at different levels of abstraction. Mutation ideas are
used with requirements, formal specifications, architectural design notations,
informal descriptions (e.g. use cases) and hardware. Mutation is now
established as a major concept in software and systems V&amp;V and uses of
mutation are increasing. The goal of the Mutation workshop is to provide a
forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss new and emerging trends in
mutation analysis. We invite submissions of both full-length and short-length
research papers as well as industry practice papers.</span></p>

     criteria (theoretical analyses and practical applications).</span></li>
 <li><span>Mutation-based test data
     generation.</span></li>
 <li><span>Higher order mutation testing.</span></li>

 <li><span>Empirical studies of mutation
     testing.</span></li>
 <li><span>Formal theoretical analysis of
     mutation testing.</span></li>

     studies that compare mutation testing with other testing techniques).</span></li>
 <li><span>Mutation testing tools.</span></li>
 <li><span>Industrial experience with
     mutation testing.</span></li>
 <li><span>New mutation systems for yet
     unaddressed programming languages and for higher-level descriptive.</span></li>
 <li><span>Mutation for mobile, internet,
     and cloud based systems (QoS, power consumption,
     etc).</span></li>
 <li><span>Mutation for
     non-functionalities&nbsp;including security, reliability, performance,
     etc.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=TOC-Types-of-Submissions></a>Types of Submissions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Three types of papers can be
submitted to the workshop:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li ><span>Full papers (10 pages):
     Research, case studies.</span></li>
 <li ><span>Short papers (6 pages): Research
     in progress, tools, experience reports, new ideas.</span></li>
 <li ><span>Industrial papers (6 pages):
     Applications and lessons learned in industry.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Each paper must conform to the
two columns IEEE conference publication format (<a
href="http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting"><span
style='color:#551A8B'>http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting</span></a>)
and must be submitted in PDF. Submissions will be evaluated according to the
relevance and originality of the work and to their ability to generate
discussions between the participants of the workshop. Three reviewers will
review each paper and all the accepted papers will be published as part of the
ICST proceedings.</span></p>

<h2><a name=TOC-Special-Issue-on-Mutation-Testing></a>Special Issue on Mutation
Testing</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:3'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-language:EN-GB'>Authors
of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers
to a special issue on mutation testing, published by the journal of Software
Testing, Verification and Reliability (STVR). The extended papers will go
through the regular review process but will be assigned at least one reviewer
from the Mutation 2017 Program Committee.</span> </p>

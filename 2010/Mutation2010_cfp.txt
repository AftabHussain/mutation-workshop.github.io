CALL FOR PAPERS

Mutation 2010: The 5th International Workshop on Mutation Analysis
April 6-9, 2010 (exact date to be determined), Paris, France

http://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/mutation2010

Co-located with ICST 2010 (3rd International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation)

About Mutation 2010:
--------------------------------
Mutation is acknowledged as an important way to assess the fault-finding effectiveness of tests sets. Mutation testing has mostly been applied at the source code level, but more recently, related ideas have also been used to test artifacts described in a considerable variety of notations and at different levels of abstraction. Mutation ideas are used with requirements, formal specifications, architectural design notations, informal descriptions (e.g. use cases) and hardware. Mutation is now established as a major concept in software and systems V&V and uses of mutation are increasing. The goal of the Mutation workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss new and emerging trends in mutation analysis. We invite submissions of both full-length and short-length research papers as well as industry practice papers.

Keynote Speaker:
-----------------------
- Mark Harman, Kings College, UK

Topics of interest:
-----------------------
- Mutation-based test adequacy criteria (theory or practical application).
- Mutation testing using higher order mutants.
- Test-case generation using mutants.
- Using mutation in empirical studies (e.g. studies that compare mutation with other testing techniques).
- Industrial experience with mutation.
- New mutation systems for programming languages (e.g. for languages not yet addressed, or offering improvements on existing ones) and for higher-level descriptive notations (e.g. formal specification notations and architectural design notations).
- Novel applications of mutation including mutation for QoS properties (security, performance, etc.).

Submissions & Publication:
------------------------------------
Two types of papers can be submitted to the workshop:
- Full papers (10 pages): Research, case studies
- Short papers (6 pages): Research in progress, tools, experience reports, problem descriptions, new ideas

Each submitted paper must conform to the IEEE format and submission guidelines. Submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the work and to their ability to generate discussions between the participants of the workshop. Each paper will be reviewed by three reviewers, and accepted papers will be published in the IEEE Digital Library. 


Important Dates:
---------------------
Submission of full papers: January 15, 2010 
Notification of acceptance: March 2, 2010 
Camera-Ready: March 26, 2010 
Date of workshop: April 6-9, 2010 (to be determined)

CALL FOR PAPERS

Mutation 2011: The 6th International Workshop on Mutation Analysis
March 21-25, 2011 (exact date to be determined), Berlin, Germany

http://antares.sip.ucm.es/mutation2011/

Co-located with ICST 2011 (4th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation)

About Mutation 2011:
--------------------------------
Mutation is acknowledged as an important way to assess the fault-finding effectiveness of tests sets. 
Mutation testing has mostly been applied at the source code level, but more recently, related ideas have 
also been used to test artifacts described in a considerable variety of notations and at different levels 
of abstraction. Mutation ideas are used with requirements, formal specifications, architectural design 
notations, informal descriptions (e.g. use cases) and hardware. Mutation is now established as a major 
concept in software and systems V&V and uses of mutation are increasing. The goal of the Mutation workshop 
is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss new and emerging trends in mutation 
analysis. We invite submissions of both full-length and short-length research papers as well as industry 
practice papers.


Topics of interest:
-----------------------
- Mutation-based test adequacy criteria (theory or practical application).
- Mutation testing using higher order mutants.
- Test-case generation using mutants.
- Using mutation in empirical studies (e.g. studies that compare mutation with other testing techniques).
- Industrial experience with mutation.
- New mutation systems for programming languages (e.g. for languages not yet addressed, or offering 
  improvements on existing ones) and for higher-level descriptive notations (e.g. formal specification 
  notations and architectural design notations).
- Novel applications of mutation including mutation for QoS properties (security, performance, etc.).

Submissions & Publication:
------------------------------------
Two types of papers can be submitted to the workshop:
- Full papers (10 pages): Research, case studies
- Short papers (6 pages): Research in progress, tools, experience reports, problem descriptions, new ideas

Each submitted paper must conform to the IEEE format and submission guidelines. Submissions will be evaluated 
according to the relevance and originality of the work and to their ability to generate discussions between 
the participants of the workshop. Each paper will be reviewed by three reviewers, and accepted papers will be
published in the IEEE Digital Library. 


Important Dates:
---------------------
Submission of full papers: December 22, 2010 
Notification of acceptance: February 1, 2011 
Date of workshop: March 21-25, 2011 (to be determined)

<h3>Evolving mutation from objects to the cloud.</h3>
<p>
As the scope of software intensive systems broadens, the landscape of software development and software testing seethes. All these development approaches emerge to face different contexts, requirements and usage of software intensive systems. In order for testing to be effective at finding errors in these various contexts, it must understand the assumptions and constraints that are imposed by a specific development approach. This allows understanding what types of errors testers must look for, what type of information they can leverage to generate and run test cases and how the testing activity can be integrated in the global development process.
This talk introduces the question-learn-test-feedback methodological pattern that we have followed to develop testing research contributions in the context of different software construction paradigms (from OO to MDE). A critical part of this pattern is to understand the types of faults that can occur in the context of one paradigm. This then leads to the specification of mutation operators to evaluate the effectiveness of testing contributions or compare different testing approaches. We will illustrate how the definition of specific mutation operators for AOP and security has led to new testing contributions. We will also discuss perspectives for fault models in the emerging cloud computing paradigm, that suggest perspectives for testing cloud applications
